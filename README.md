Creating a Power BI dashboard for Zomato sales can involve multiple data points and visualizations. Here are three key points to consider:

Sales Analysis:-
Visualize total sales with bar charts, pie charts, or line graphs over different periods (daily, weekly, monthly).
Segment sales data by categories like veg and non-veg to understand customer preferences.
Highlight top-performing restaurants and dishes to identify trends and bestsellers.

Customer Ratings:-
Display average ratings for each restaurant, using star ratings or color-coded heat maps.
Track changes in ratings over time to monitor performance and customer satisfaction.
Analyze ratings in conjunction with sales data to see if higher-rated dishes correlate with increased sales.

City-wise Analysis:-
Create a bar visualization to show city-wise sales distribution.
Use tables or charts to compare sales and ratings across different cities, highlighting top-performing and underperforming regions.
